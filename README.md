1.a). Realize a mathematical logistic regression model for the binary classification of 'Occupancy' according to 'CO2' and 'Light'. b). Draw the decision boundary. 2. Perform a mathematical logistic regression model for the binary classification of 'Occupancy' as a function of 'Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Light', 'CO2' and 'HumidityRatio'.
